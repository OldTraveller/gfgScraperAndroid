Not a very complicated application !! 
Built as an extension to the gfgScraper designed before.
CodeChef stores the program code in the "code" class now. ( Earlier between the pre tags i think ) 
Reduces the effort to find the common programs to just one click away.
Jsoup it is... for scraping the code.
